## coad meeting notes 5-25-17

* in ohio, lead hazards in homes are often established with a blood lead level test for children.  
a positive result leads to intervention from the state with the landlord deemed responsible.  federal title 10 law is relevant.  ohio has mobile labs for the purpose of testing.
tolendo, OH has especially strict landlord-tenant law around this; any lead dust found leads to intervention.

* it's also possible to do a dust wipe sample.  paint chips aren't really dangerous until they're ground into dust.  the dust is usually tested via XRF
the testing lab probably needs a specific license. 30-50 ppm? is considered dangerous for lead dust.

* lawyers defending landlords might be able to call the expertise of a testing lab into question.  but by the same token, lawyers defending tenants might be able to vouch for the accuracy of diy lab tests
